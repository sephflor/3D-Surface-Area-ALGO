# 3D-Surface-Area-ALGO.This program calculates the total surface area of a 3D shape formed by stacks of cubes on a 2D grid. It adds 2 for the top and bottom of each stack and, for each of the four sides, adds the positive difference between the current stack height and its neighborâ€™s height, summing these contributions for the final surface area.
